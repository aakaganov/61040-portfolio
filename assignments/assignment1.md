# Assignment 1
## Domains
1) **Reading** : I love reading books. I have many different books I want to read across many different genres. Going to libraries and used book stores is always so fun because I get to find new books to read. I often feel like I don't have enough time to read, especially during the semester. 
2) Crocheting 
3) Hanging out with friends 
4) Waking up early 
5) Decorating 
6) Language learning
7) Going to restaurants/trying new food 
8) Data collecting (ex. Spotify wrapped)
9) **Fish tanks** : My family has had a salt water fish tank for almost as long as I have been alive. Everyone in my family loves the fish, but my dad is particularly passionate about the hobby of fish tanks. We have a 19 year old clown fish named Kimmy. Fish are often mistreated as pets, but after having fish for so long it is quite interesting to see how different fish have different personalities. Keeping fish can be very difficult because different fish have different requirements related to salinity, tank size, food, and tank mates. 
10) **Social media** : Social media is an interesting double edged sword. On one hand apps such as snapchat allow me to stay in contact with friends in a very easy way. Other apps like instagram allow me to share parts of my life with my friends while being able to see parts of their life. Youtube has many interesting videos about pretty much every topic completely free for users to watch. On the other hand, it acts as an addicting time sink, when I scroll endlessly for long periods of time it turns a positive into a negative. 
## Problems
  ### Reading :
  > **Distractions while reading** : I often feel like during the semester I have no time to read, however I know that some of the time I spend watching shows or playing on my phone could be spent reading. The problem of better allocating free time to include reading is a problem I selected because it is a problem that I personally struggle with and it is a problem that seems to be quite common. 

  > Wanting to talk to someone about a book, but having no one to talk with about it : In order for this idea to properly work it would need a large number of users who do not know each other, because if they did know each other they would already have someone to talk to about the book.

  > No ideas for what to read next : I chose to not include this problem because there are already so many resources on figuring out what book to read next online and in person. Those who work at book stores and libraries are often incredibly willing to help along with having the needed skillset. Online there are forums and websites designed to help readers figure out what they want to read next based on the books they have read in the past. Overall, there is a lack of need for this product because there are already many solutions. 
  ### Fish tanks:
>**Fish Compatibility** : In order for a fish to thrive it needs to be in the right environment. This environment includes factors such as size of the fish tank, salinity, food, size of the tank, and compatibility with other fish. While research is very important, it is often quite difficult. This problem is something that could very well be automated and there is a need for, while of course it is possible for someone to research independently, speaking from experience it can be hard to find the information for your specific tank. 

>Mass dying events : Mass dying events are when all or most of the fish in a fish tank die for some reason or another. I chose not to pick this problem because it is often a manual solution and the problem is usually low oxygen so identifying it with some form of app is not the most useful. 

>Algal blooms : Algal blooms are when algae overgrows in a fish tank for some reason or another. When such events occur they can lead to mass dying events due to the overuse of oxygen. The reason I did not select this problem is similar to why I did not select mass dying events, it is because both the solution and the reasoning are incredibly googlable and do not need an app to tell you what to do or to identify a problem. 
  ### Social media:
>**Spending too much time on social media** : Social media is a known time sink. I personally really struggle with being unable to use social media for a reasonable amount of time, I frequently start scrolling and lose hours without even realizing it. I have 4 different screen time limiting apps, whose varying features I try and use to fix this issue, even with all of these features combined, even with these apps I still overuse my phone by requesting to break through screentime blocks, or in some cases, deleting apps. I have selected this problem because I know I am one of many people who struggle with this issue. While there are many apps out there that exist for this issue, I have not been able to find a combo that truly works for me, and I imagine the same is applicable for many others. 
			
>Missing too many important notifications : There are people who use social media to stay in contact with people, however these messages can be lost amongst less important or less time sensitive messages. While this is a problem for some, I did not end up selecting because I don’t believe there is a significant enough number of people with this issue who will end up needing an entire app to solve the problem, additionally, if the problem was that serious for some people they would likely request to use a different messaging service like iMessage.

>Following spam bots : Spam bots are a prominent issue on social media. From bots that impersonate people you follow, to bots that spam follow requests, they are annoying and can be a potential security threat. While this is a prominent issue, I did not select the problem because I believe at this point in time there are more people who need a solution to the problem of spending too much time on social media than a solution to the problem of spam bots. Even when people do accidentally follow these bots, the majority of harm is done when they give them some form of information, and a majority of people know not to do this.  

## Stakeholders
  ### Distractions while reading :
>**Readers** : The individual who reads the books and the end user of the product. There are many benefits to individuals who read. By providing a way to encourage individuals to increase the amount of free time they spend reading, it allows them to actually receive the benefits of this hobby. Additionally, it would allow people to spend more time doing what they enjoy, when they would typically get distracted.  

>**Libraries and local book stores** : Libraries and local book stores are an important aspect to society, they provide free or affordable access to books to communities who may not always be able to afford them. With the rise in the internet, there are less and less readers. This decrease in reading by the population is both harmful for the population and for libraries and local books stores. With fewer readers, more and more of such stores and libraries will go out of business, a solution to the problem of distracted reading and less reading will benefit libraries and book stores by providing more readers.

>**Educators** : Educators want students to learn and succeed academically. Students who read are more likely to perform better academically in all subjects. Encouraging students to read by limiting distractions, especially in an era filled with distractions, aids in the overall goal of the success of students. 

  ### Fish Compatibility :
>**Fish owners** :  Fish are regarded as ‘easy pets’ and in many ways they are, which is why there are so many fish owners, however there is still research required for properly taking care of fish, just like any other animal. Generally speaking, no one who buys a fish wants that fish to die, creating an app that makes research easier for fish owners will drastically improve the experience people will have in owning fish by making the probability their fish die far less likely, saving both money and emotional heartache.

>**Fish** :  The common misconception that fish don’t feel pain so the neglect is more acceptable is a false narrative. While I don't blame the miseducated fish owner who often is doing what they think is right, many pet fish live unnecessarily short and painful lives. A solution to the difficulty of finding fish compatible with your specific tank set up would allow for more pet fish to thrive, living long and healthy lives. 

>**Fish store owners/employees** : There are many different types of places to buy fish. Smaller, more local fish stores tend to care about the wellbeing of the fish they are selling and have employees who want to help the customers who are buying. These types of stores would benefit from a product that would make the process of researching fish easier. On the other hand larger companies, such as Petco, are known for mistreating the fish at their own store and having employees who are uneducated in relation to fish. Such stores may benefit from a customer being misinformed in regards to fish as it leads to higher profits from people buying more fish. Such companies would not benefit from a product that made customers more educated about owning fish. 

  ### Spending too much time on social media :
>**Social media user**: Many people use social media, of these individuals many have a negative relationship with such apps, in some cases an addiction. Social media addictions can take away so much of a person's time. It can lead to less meaningful connections with people they know, harmful to their productivity at work and school, take away from hobbies and passions, and even lead to harmful real life consequences(ex. cyber bullying). Having a way to fix and limit social media time can have many positive impacts on the individual, including improved social life, productivity, and passions. Many people have a desire to fix this problem but don't find the current screen time apps to be fixing the problem in a way that works for them. 

>**Social media company**: Social media is designed to be addicting. These companies benefit from people spending more time on their apps, as a result they design them to make it hard to leave the app. This stakeholder would not benefit from a screen time app. This type of stakeholder is important to keep in mind to see what kind of tactics they would use that might hurt the success of a screen time app. 

>**Family and friends of chronic social media users**: Social media is built to connect people, but in the process it often isolates people from their loved ones in real life. When people are able to spend less time on their phone, they are able to spend more time with the people they care about, benefiting the family and friends of the user of this product.

US adults time spent leasure reading has gone down from 23 minutes in 2004 to under 16 minutes in 2018. However, it must be acknowledged that social media apps have also allowed readers to find more books, increasing book sales. 

> [The hidden cost of a smartphone: The effects of smartphone notifications on cognitive control from a behavioral and electrophysiological perspective](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9671478/): Studies show that distractions from instant messages drastically reduce reading comprehension. Distracted readers ended up not being able to process the text as deeply as non distracted readers.

Such strengthening helps prevent age related decline along with improving empathy, vocab, and critical thinking. Reading helps increase concentration in problem solving while passive media such as social media does not. 
  ### Fish Compatibility :
> [Pet Ownership Statistics](https://spots.com/pet-ownership-statistics/): In the US, freshwater fish are the most common pet with 139.3 million pet freshwater fish. On average, people who own fish own 11-12 fish. 10.9% of American households own fish.

> [Fish compatability chart](https://theifishstore.com/pages/compatibility-chart?srsltid=AfmBOoosR8tx34vtcmi55-8a-rCYxWq0DvRP2xQ3zRtEid2s6HU_rPlN): While there already exists fish compatability charts, this charts can be hard to read, and are more for if you want to see if two fish are compatable, however most fish tanks have several types of fish, making it hard to figure out what fish would be a good addition to the tank. Additionally, such charts dont take into considersation other aspects of compatability, such as tank size, temperature, and salinaty.

> [10 Most Common Reasons Why the Fish Die](https://www.bunnycart.com/blog/10-most-common-reasons-why-the-fish-die/#:~:text=Improper%20tank%20is%20the%20most,few%20days%20or%20a%20week.) : Improper tank preparation, tank size, and tankmates are some of the most common ways fish die. These issues are largely caused by lack of knowledge in regards to the hobby of fish tanks.

> [Pain in fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_in_fish) : Fish fufil many of the scientifitc criteria for being able to experience pain, including nervous system and sensory receptors, opioid receptors, reduced responses to painful stimuli when given pain killers, pyscological changes to painful stimuli, and avoidance learning. While fish may not be able to experience pain the way humans experience pain, the common misconception that fish simply dont experience pain is an incorrect assumption.
