##Problem statement
**A problem domain** :  Social media - I enjoy spending time on social media, I like how it has the potential to connect people and keep people in contact with each other. However I do not like it when it becomes too much of a distraction or time sink. 

**A problem** : Social media is designed to keep a user on the app for as long as possible. This is good for the company, bad for the user. Many people still want to be able to access the app for content or connection with others, but they don't want the addiction or doom scrolling associated with the application. It's a very common problem for social media users to spend too much time on the phone, become addicted, or lose track of time. Such actions affect individuals' sleep, productivity, and stress.
