## Problem statement 

**A problem domain** : Social media - I enjoy spending time on social media, I like how it has the potential to connect people and keep people in contact with each other. However I do not like it when it becomes too much of a distraction or time sink.

**A problem** : Social media is designed to keep a user on the app for as long as possible. This is good for the company, bad for the user. Many people still want to be able to access the app for content or connection with others, but they don't want the addiction or doom scrolling associated with the application. It's a very common problem for social media users to spend too much time on the phone, become addicted, or lose track of time. Such actions affect individuals' sleep, productivity, and stress.
**A stakeholder list** : 
1) User - The individual who uses social media too often. This is the user who would directly benefit from an app that limits social media use. This includes children who should only be given access to certain features of an app, students who need to focus on classwork but spend too much time on their phone, and adults in workplace settings where such distractions are unprofessional. This user would be the individual who uses this product.<br>
2) 2nd degree user - This is the individual who is affected by someone in their life who overuses social media. This is an individual who may encourage the user to find a solution, such as this product. These individuals can include friends/partners who want to spend more time with a user/may notice these problems a user has with social media, parents who want to fix or prevent addictions within their kid, and teachers who may notice focus and behavioral issues in different students with social media addictions. The 2nd degree user is the individual who benefits from another's use of our product. <br>
3) Companies - Companies creating the distracting apps, unlike users and 2nd degree users, benefit from an individual's excessive social media use. Part of the reason so many people have such issues is because social media is designed to be addicting. This stakeholder is negatively impacted by the product, as a result the solutions must keep in mind potential ways social media companies may hinder the success and effectiveness of the product.<br>
